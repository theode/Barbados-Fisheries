# Introduction

This tutorial intends to walk you through coding the retrieval, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and reporting of fish catch and effort data using the R Statistical Software and selected packages. Each step will be detailed and outputs thereof displayed and explained for your understanding.

Just a few thinks to note as we progress:

- Comments in the code are prefaced with a hash tag **"#"**.
- The text, though handy, is meant to be accompanied by input from the lecturer. Everything may not be explained according to the needs of the student. So questions are encouraged.  

```{r}
#| label: to-do
#| include: false

# 1. change "_ec" for variables in main_data to "_bbd" to reflect the Barbadian currency
# 2. Add in reference files for questionnaire and loo-up lists
# 3. Figure out what is going on with collection_agent, collection_agent_001 and collection_agent_002
```

```{r}
#| label: log
#| include: false

# 20231221: Created script, added text on introduction, added raw data

```

## Set-up

### Folder structure

This tutorial assumes that you use projects within RStudio. Added to that, it uses the following folder structure (automatically generated using the **"r4np"** package):

::: {.callout-important}

A tutorial on project set-up and r4np is found here (Chapter 6 from 6.1 to 6.2): <https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/starting-your-r-projects.html>

:::

```{r}
#| label: file-directory-structure
#| echo: false


d01 <- data.frame(folder_name = list.dirs(path = ".", full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE),
                  explanation = c("Github file",
                                  "R-project user file",
                                  "All raw data files are stored here",
                                  "Tidy, cleaned or processed data from our code are stored here",
                                  "Scripts and other files with executable code",
                                  "Output plots",
                                  "Output reports in various formats",
                                  "Miscellaneous files"))

knitr::kable(d01[3:8,], row.names = FALSE,
             caption = "*Folder structure used in this tutorial*")
```

### R-Packages

The following packages are loaded and used for this tutorial:

```{r}
#| label: libraries
#| output: false

library(tidyverse) # For plots, reshaping data and summaries. Takes the place of ggplot2, dplyr,  tidyr, stringr, lubridate, readr, and others
library(readxl) # For reading MS Excel files
library(writexl) # For writing MS Excel files
library(here) # Used for finding files within your project. See more information at https://github.com/jennybc/here_here/blob/master/README.md and https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script
library(janitor) # For some data exploration, cleaning and other useful functionality
library(scales) # For number formats
library(knitr) # For neat tables
library(patchwork) # for arranging multiple plots
library(flextable) # for creating fancy tables. More info here: https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/
library(tidyselect) # implements a specialised sublanguage of R for selecting variables from data frames and other data structures
```

# Getting to know the data

## Accessing and downloading the data

The data used in this tutorial is sourced from a KoboToolbox[^1] project created to collect fish catch and effort data in Barbados, specifically the **"\[DRAFT\] Barbados Routine Fisheries Field Data Collection Form"**. There are multiple methods of accessing data from KoboToolbox servers, however, we will be using the XLS download method in this tutorial. 

To access the data (assuming that you have a KoboToolbox account and was given access to the project) log in to your account, open the project and head to the **"DATA"** tab at the top. See @fig-kobo-data below.

[^1]: <https://www.kobotoolbox.org/>

![*KoboToolbox data tab*](images/Screenshot%20KoboToolbox-data.png){#fig-kobo-data}

On the left side (@fig-kobo-downloads), select "Downloads". Pay attention to the settings highlighted and ensure that you have the same. When you are done, select **"EXPORT"**.

![*KoboToolbox downloads side-tab*](images/Screenshot%20KoboToolbox-downloads.png){#fig-kobo-downloads}

KoboToolbox generates an Excel (XLS) file. Click the **"Download"** button to get your file (@fig-kobo-xls).

## Importing data into R
The data from the KoboToolbox server is stored in an Excel Workbook which has multiple sheets. Reminiscent of a database, the sheets are linked using a key variable, named the UUID. One sheet acts as the main table and is linked to several sub-tables in a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship. These are the collected data. But, before we begin looking at the actual data collected, we will import the reference tables.

### Reference tables

Reference tables store background information on the collected data. In this exercise, this includes the questionnaire and the look-up lists. The questionnaire gives added context to the variables found in the main and sub tables. The look-up lists help with decoding the choice options for those questions. Both will come in handy as we explore our data.

::: {.callout-tip}

The reference tables can be downloaded from the KoboToolbox project. 

:::

```{r}
#| label: ref-tables
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# questionnaire ----
ref_questionnaire <- read_xlsx(here("00_raw_data", "questionnaire", "aD3ds4EVZTq8SfR9dYGqdJ.xlsx"),
                               # Select the Excel sheet to load
                               sheet = "survey") |> 
  # We split the "type" variable into two
  separate(col = type, into = c("type", "look_up"), sep = " ")

# look-up-lists ----
ref_look_ups <- read_xlsx(here("00_raw_data", "questionnaire", "aD3ds4EVZTq8SfR9dYGqdJ.xlsx"),
                               sheet = "choices")
```

### Main table

The **readxl()** package will be used to import the data into R. We begin with the main table, called **main_table** in this tutorial.

```{r}
#| label: import-data

main_table <- read_xlsx(here("00_raw_data", "kobotoolbox", "DRAFT_Barbados_Routine_Fisheries_Field_Data_Collection_Form_-_latest_version_-_False_-_2023-12-21-20-05-18.xlsx"),
                       # Select which sheet to access and load
                       sheet = "_DRAFT_ Barbados Routine Fis...") |>
  # Clean and standardize the variable names so they are R-friendly
  clean_names() |>
  # Exclude unneeded variables
  select(!matches("^intro_|^note|^username|deviceid|submitted_by")) |>
  # Make some minor edits to data in all variables: This "--" is converted to NA
  mutate(across(everything(), ~gsub("\\--", NA, .)))
```

The resulting **main_table** variables are:

```{r}
#| label: vars-main-table
#| echo: false

d01 <- data.frame(variable_code = names(main_table)) |> 
  left_join(ref_questionnaire[, c("name", "label")], by = c("variable_code" = "name")) |> 
  mutate(across(label, ~str_replace_all(., "\\#", "")))

kable(d01)

# str(main_table)
```
